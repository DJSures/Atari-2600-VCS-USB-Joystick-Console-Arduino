# Atari-2600-VCS-USB-Joystick-Console-Arduino
Code for the Arduino Micro that emulates joysticks and console buttons for the Raspberry Pi Retro Pie Atari 2600 emulator. I connected the Arduino Micro directly to the IC Sockets of the original PCB, that way the switches are in their correct place. The build hack link below demonstrates how i did that. Removing the IC's from the PCB exposed all of the I/O of the switches and joystick.
